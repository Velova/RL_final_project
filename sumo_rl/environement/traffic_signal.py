    state = [phase_one_hot, min_green, queue_N, queue_E, queue_S, queue_W]
    where:
    - phase_one_hot: it is a one-hot encoded vector of the current active green phase, with length equal to the number of possible phases for the intersection.
    - min_green: Is a binary variable indicating whether minimum green time has been reached in the current phase (1 if minimum green time has been reached, 0 otherwise).
    - queue_N, queue_E, queue_S, queue_W: are the number of vehicles in the queue for each direction (North, East, South, West) respectively.
    - ped_N, ped_E, ped_S, ped_W: are the number of waiting pedestrians for each direction (North, East, South, West) respectively.

    Action space is discrete, corresponding to which green phase is going to be activated.
