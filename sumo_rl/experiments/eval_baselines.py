"""
Baseline evaluation script — Single Intersection.

Runs Fixed-Time and Max Pressure agents for one episode each and prints a
comparison table with the metrics from the project proposal:
  - Average vehicle waiting time  (lower is better)
  - Average queue length          (lower is better)
  - Constraint violation rate     (target: 0%)
  - Total episode reward
